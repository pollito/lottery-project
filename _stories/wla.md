If the global lottery industry is a living organism, a strong argument can be made that its nerve center is Basel, Switzerland.

There, on Lange Gasse 20, stands the headquarters of the [World Lottery Association](https://www.world-lotteries.org/about-us/our-offices)(WLA). Since its inception in 1999, the self-described lobbying group has sought to [fulfill its mission](https://www.world-lotteries.org/about-us/about-the-wla) of supporting state lotteries’ growth around the world and upholding standards of ethical conduct, charitable giving and responsible gambling.

Heavily backed by eight major lottery companies, the WLA appears to be succeeding in at least its growth objective.  Worldwide lottery revenue surged from [$160-billion in 2003](http://www.lotteryinsider.com/vol67/no3.htm), shortly after the organisation began, to [$293-billion in 2014](https://www.world-lotteries.org/images/publications/compendia/wla-compendium-2015.pdf). Association members accounted for 93 percent of that revenue, according to the Global Lottery Data Compendium 2015. The organisation said in a statement that it has certified 55, or more than one third, of its member lotteries at the highest level of its responsible gambling program.  It asserts on its website that all members contribute the majority of net revenues to good causes.

But an upcoming national survey of American state lotteries by [PennLive](http://www.pennlive.com/) and students from the [Columbia Journalism School](https://journalism.columbia.edu/) raises questions about the association’s gambling certification program. A [document ](http://www.illinoislottery.com/content/dam/ill/documents/LCB%20Meeting%20Minutes%2010-10-12%20%282%29.pdf)from the [Illinois Lottery](http://illinoislottery.com/), a WLA member, appears to contradict the organisation’s assertion about the percentage of charitable cause donations. And the association’s location in Switzerland, a country with few disclosure requirements for non-profit associations, seems to go against the organisation’s stated commitment to transparency for its members.

Questions that were submitted to the World Lottery Association

I. In 2012, the annual Platinum level of contribution was 175,000 CHF.  What is the current annual level of contribution for Platinum and Gold members, and what percentage of the WLA's budget do these eight companies supply?

II. You are probably aware of the studies that lotteries function as a regressive tax. In other words, that people in lower-income groups disproportionately tend to resort to lotteries, spend a higher percentage of their income on lotteries and that lottery outlets are also sometimes concentrated in the areas where they live. Do you accept that lotteries may in some cases function to draw income out of poor areas?

III. If you recognise this as a potential problem, what concrete steps has the WLA taken to work against the phenomenon of lotteries functioning as a regressive tax?

IV. On its website, the WLA describes its commitment to responsible gaming and has a formal process by which lotteries are evaluated.  But our survey of American state lotteries shows that there are four WLA members-Oregon, Connecticut, Nebraska and Pennsylvania-that do not track frequent winners, even though our reporting has shown that a number of frequent winners are problem gamblers.   Do you confirm that these four states do not track frequent winners?

V. Do you accept that frequency of winning may indicate a gambling addiction or problem?

VI. If Pennsylvania and Connecticut do not track potential problem gamblers, can you explain how they are accredited by the WLA at Level 2 in the Responsible Gaming Framework?  

VII. The WLA states on its website that all members contribute the majority of net revenues to good causes, but the percentage of revenue that has gone to education from WLA Member, the Illinois Lottery, has steadily fallen from 41 percent in the mid-80s to about 23 percent earlier this decade.  In 2012 then-Lottery Director Michael Jones explained that the percentage of funding to education had decreased in order to increase the percentage prize payout. Can you explain why education would have been defunded by the Illinois Lottery? Relatedly, on what basis is the claim on the WLA’s website still made that the majority of revenue contributions go to good causes when this appears to be inaccurate?

VIII. the WLA as NPO association in Switzerland is subject to legal and financial secrecy laws by its discretion. Why is the organisation located in Switzerland and is there worry that use of a tax haven gives a wrong face to the organisation?

IX. Can we access disaggregated financials from 1999?

X. Does WLA by-laws require a code of conduct from members on transparency and anti-corruption - specifically, partner states they may be involved with?
