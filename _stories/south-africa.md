### The team

In South Africa the Gaming the Lottery team was headed up by Raymond Joseph. Others involved were data journalists Daniela Lepiz and Roxanne Joseph, data analyst Adi Eyal and data wrangler/analyst Damian Schlechter and [OCCRP](https://www.occrp.org/en) Africa editor Khadija Sharife. [TRACE](https://openup.org.za/trace), a project of civic tech organisation [OpenUp](https://openup.org.za/) scraped the lottery data and assisted with research and analysis. The [Fund for Investigative Journalism](http://fij.org/) supported the project. A special thanks to Seamus Reynolds for additional research and support.

### Search the Lottery

Since the first grants to “good causes” were made by the South African Lottery in 2002, thousands of organisations, mostly not-for-profit but some private and for profit, have received funding.

In this example start with a search for “Olympics” and then search for variations. If an organisation has an acronym, search for that too.

Or if you looking for a school or schools and are not sure of their exact names, begin your search with “school” and then search through the results for the one/s you’re looking for.

### About the South African Lottery

When the South African Lottery was launched in South Africa in March 2000 it outlawed most other lottery-type games and scratch cards, badly affected some non-profit organisations that were using these games for fund raising.

A percentage of the weekly proceeds are paid over by the licensed lottery operator  – appointed every seven years and currently Ithuba - to the National Lottery Commission, which is regulated  by the Department of Trade and Industry.

The money is allocated in terms of four categories: Charities, Sports and Recreation, Arts, Culture and National Heritage and Miscellaneous. Over the years almost R22- billion has been granted to “good causes”.

Adjudications on funding applications are done by committees – known as distributing agencies – which are appointed by the Minister of Trade and Industry.
