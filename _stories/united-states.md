Lottery players across the country are winning the lottery dozens, [hundreds ](http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-men-won-lotto-hundreds-times-collected-millions-article-1.3201318)and even [thousands](https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2017/08/03/lawbreakers-just-really-lucky-mass-has-more-repeat-lottery-winners-than-any-other-state/UD2CzeJHJl5lO8R2WXftBN/story.html) of times in the face of almost inconceivably low odds.

This part of the project built on [Lawrence Mower’s](https://twitter.com/lmower3?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) groundbreaking 2014 [investigation](http://www.mypalmbeachpost.com/gaming-the-lottery/) into frequent winners for the [Palm Beach Post](http://www.palmbeachpost.com) that journalists replicated in [about a dozen other states](http://www.garibaldibros.com/wp/lottery/). 

We wrote Freedom of Information Act requests to every lottery in the country, eventually compiling more than 11 million records from 36 out of 45 lotteries. We conducted a survey about oversight of repeat winners that all but a couple of lotteries answered. And we read hundreds of financial and performance audits.

<p class="more-start"></p>

Eventually, we found frequent winning occurring in lotteries throughout the country.  But oversight on this area was decidedly mixed, with 10 countries telling us they did not monitor frequent winners in a systematic way.  

Our reporting preceded the [first-ever arrests](http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/new-yorkers-jailed-lottery-scheme-article-1.3234929) and the closure of seven stores for violations in this in New York. Officials in [Massachusetts](http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2017/08/mass_lottery_officials_to_crac.html)and [Connecticut](http://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc-lottery-big-winners-20170817-story.html) announced planned and possible changes to their policies after we presented them with our findings.
